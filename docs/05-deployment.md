# Deployment

This document provides guidance on deploying the **DrSharad Smile Architect** Next.js application.

## Overview

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms that support Node.js. The optimal deployment strategy often depends on the specific needs of the application, such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and image optimization.

## Recommended Platforms

*   **Vercel**: As the creators of Next.js, Vercel offers seamless, zero-configuration deployment for Next.js projects. It automatically handles build processes, optimizations (including Image Optimization, Internationalization, etc.), and provides a global CDN.
    *   **Setup**:
        1.  Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
        2.  Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
        3.  Import your Git repository. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Next.js project.
        4.  Configure environment variables in the Vercel project settings if needed.
        5.  Deploy. Vercel will build and deploy your application, providing a unique URL. Custom domains can also be configured.

*   **Netlify**: Another popular platform for deploying modern web applications, including Next.js. Netlify also offers CI/CD, serverless functions, and a global CDN.
    *   **Setup**: Similar to Vercel, connect your Git repository, configure build settings (often auto-detected), set environment variables, and deploy.

*   **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: For more control and custom infrastructure, AWS offers several options:
    *   **AWS Amplify**: A fully managed service for deploying web and mobile applications.
    *   **EC2 with PM2/Docker**: Deploy to a virtual server (EC2 instance) and manage the Node.js process using PM2 or containerize the application with Docker.
    *   **Serverless (Lambda with API Gateway)**: Deploy Next.js API routes and server-side rendering logic as Lambda functions. This is more complex to set up.

*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
    *   **Cloud Run**: Deploy containerized applications (including Next.js) in a serverless environment.
    *   **App Engine**: A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering.

*   **Azure**:
    *   **Azure App Service**: Deploy web applications with support for Node.js.
    *   **Azure Static Web Apps**: Can be used for statically exported Next.js sites or sites with API functions.

## General Deployment Steps

1.  **Build the Application**:
    Before deployment, ensure your application builds correctly for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Most hosting platforms provide a way to set environment variables for your deployed application. Ensure all required variables (e.g., `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_...`) are configured in the deployment environment.

3.  **Choose a Hosting Provider**: Select a provider based on your project's requirements, budget, and desired level of control.

4.  **Connect Git Repository (CI/CD)**:
    For automated deployments, connect your Git repository to the hosting platform. This enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), where changes pushed to specific branches (e.g., `main` or `master`) automatically trigger a new build and deployment.

5.  **Run the Application**:
    If deploying to a traditional server or container, you'll need to start the Next.js application in production mode:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This command serves the optimized build from the `.next` folder. Process managers like PM2 are recommended for keeping the Node.js application alive and managing logs.

## Considerations for Next.js Features

*   **Server Components & Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Requires a Node.js runtime environment on the server. Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and Node.js-capable PaaS/IaaS solutions handle this well.
*   **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: If your site is largely static, you can export it as static HTML/CSS/JS files using `next export` (though this has limitations with newer App Router features). These static files can be hosted on any static hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, AWS S3). However, for full Next.js feature support, a Node.js environment is generally preferred even for SSG-heavy sites.
*   **API Routes**: Require a Node.js server environment or a serverless function environment.
*   **Image Optimization**: Next.js's built-in image optimization (`next/image`) works best on platforms that support it (like Vercel) or requires custom setup on other platforms.

For the **DrSharad Smile Architect** project, **Vercel** is highly recommended due to its tight integration with Next.js and ease of use.
